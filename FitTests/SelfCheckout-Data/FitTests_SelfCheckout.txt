Starting Fit Tests for -SelfCheckout- data 

Starting Uniform fit...
Uniform: Alpha: 76.0 Beta: 208.0
Scale is: 132.0
ChiSquare Statistic nan P value nan
H0: (null hypothesis) Sample data follows the hypothesized distribution.
H1: (alternative hypothesis) Sample data does not follow a hypothesized distribution.
we reject the null hypothesis

# Tweaking one Variable changes the Uniform fit to not be 'nan', however the scale and loc parameters are changed and incorrect I believe:
Starting Uniform fit...
Uniform: Alpha: 0.0 Beta: 284.0
Scale is: 284.0
ChiSquare Statistic 37.432 P value 0.273
H0: (null hypothesis) Sample data follows the hypothesized distribution.
H1: (alternative hypothesis) Sample data does not follow a hypothesized distribution.
we can not reject the null hypothesis

Starting Uniform KS fit...
